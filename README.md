# Geog 575 Course Repository

This is the first repository created for Geog 575 course.

## Project Overview

The project includes a basic implementation of a Leaflet map. The map is centered at coordinates of the University of Wisconsin - Madison [43.0766, -89.4172]. The base map tiles are sourced from Stadia Maps' terrain tiles. A custom red icon is used for the map marker, sourced directly from the Leaflet tutorial found [here](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/).

## Files

- `main.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code to initialize the Leaflet map and add a custom marker.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that includes the map container and links to the Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the map and other elements on the page.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the map.
